# FizzBuzz Application
The FizzBuzz application will output the numbers specified by the user, with the numbers which are multiples of 3 being replaced with the string "Fizz", the numbers which are multiples of 5 being replaced with the string "Buzz", and finally outputting "FizzBuzz" when the multiple is of both 3 and 5.
- Multiple of 3 = "Fizz"
- Multiple of 5 = "Buzz"
- Multiple of 3 and 5 = "FizzBuzz"
- Otherwise = Number

## How to Run

## How to Change the values
